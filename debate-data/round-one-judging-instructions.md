## Judging Process

### Step 1: Initial Reading
Read the entire speech without scoring to understand the overall argument and approach.

### Step 2: Detailed Analysis
Re-read the speech, taking notes on each criterion:
- Identify key arguments and evidence (Content)
- Note persuasive techniques and emotional appeals (Persuasiveness)
- Map the speech structure and flow (Organization)
- Fact-check claims and evaluate sources (Accuracy)
- Assess communication effectiveness (Delivery)

### Step 3: Scoring
Assign scores for each criterion based on the rubrics above.

### Step 4: Feedback
Provide specific, constructive feedback for each criterion, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

## Important Considerations

### Objectivity Guidelines
- Judge the speech content, not the debater's personal characteristics
- Remain neutral on the topic regardless of your personal beliefs
- Focus on the quality of argumentation, not whether you agree with the position
- Consider the debate format and time constraints when evaluating

### Bias Mitigation
- Be aware of confirmation bias toward arguments you personally support
- Don't penalize unique or unconventional approaches if they are well-executed
- Consider cultural and stylistic differences in argumentation
- Evaluate based on the speech's effectiveness for its intended audience

### Contextual Factors
- Consider the specific round and its objectives
- Account for the debater's position (pro/con) and associated challenges
- Evaluate within the context of the overall debate format
- Consider time constraints and their impact on depth and development

## Output Format

Provide your evaluation in the following format:

```json
